Project Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for a final project built during the AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp (Sprints & Microsoft). The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, clustering (unsupervised), dimensionality reduction, and supervised classification to predict heart disease. Visualizations are produced with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Models are implemented with scikit-learn.

Dataset

Primary dataset: (provide your CSV here, e.g. heart.csv).

Example commonly used source: UCI Heart Disease dataset or Kaggle Heart Disease datasets (if you used a specific variant, replace the placeholder with the exact link/file).

Place the dataset in the data/ folder as data/heart.csv.

Required columns (typical): age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, target (0 = no disease, 1 = disease). Adjust to your actual schema.

Key Features & Methods

EDA: distribution plots, correlation matrix, missing values, pairplots.

Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn charts to explain relationships and features importance.

Unsupervised: K-Means clustering, PCA for dimensionality reduction and pattern discovery.

Supervised: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting (optional) — trained and compared.

Preprocessing: imputation, scaling (StandardScaler), categorical encoding where needed.

Model assessment: train/test split, cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1.

Quickstart / Reproduce

Clone the repo:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd heart-disease-ml


Create venv & install:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


Put your dataset as data/heart.csv.

Run the main notebook or script:

# Jupyter Notebook
jupyter lab
# Open notebooks/HeartDisease_Project.ipynb


or run the evaluation script:

python src/train_and_eval.py --data data/heart.csv --out results/

Results Summary (example — replace with your actual numbers)

Best model: Random Forest

Accuracy: 0.85

ROC-AUC: 0.92

Precision / Recall / F1: 0.83 / 0.80 / 0.81

Important features (by importance): thalach, oldpeak, cp, age, chol

Add your exact evaluation outputs and include sample visualizations (ROC curve, confusion matrix, feature importance) to results/figures/.

How to Use the Repo

notebooks/01_EDA_and_Preprocessing.ipynb — run first to understand the data and create cleaned dataset.

notebooks/02_Clustering_and_PCA.ipynb — explore clusters and visualize low-D embedding.

notebooks/03_Modeling_and_Evaluation.ipynb — training, hyperparameter search, metrics and visualizations.

Use src/train_and_eval.py for reproducible runs and to save model artifacts to results/models/.

Example command to run a full experiment:

python src/train_and_eval.py --data data/heart.csv --model random_forest --save results/

Evaluation Metrics

Reported metrics include:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve & AUC

Cross-validated scores (k-fold CV)

For clustering: Silhouette score, inertia

Limitations & Notes (be honest — this is important)

Data bias & size: If dataset is small or unbalanced, model performance can be overly optimistic. Use stratified CV and check class balance.

Feature quality: Medical datasets often require domain-specific feature engineering; raw features may not capture clinical nuances.

No clinical deployment: Models here are for learning and prototyping only — not a substitute for clinical diagnosis. Any clinical use would require rigorous validation, regulatory approvals, and domain expert review.

Reproducibility: Set random seeds; document package versions in requirements.txt.

Future Work

Add hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV or Optuna.

Try ensemble stacking and calibration (Platt scaling / isotonic).

Use SHAP for explainability and feature impact on predictions.

Collect or validate on external datasets for robustness.

If possible, consult domain experts to improve labeling and feature engineering.

Final note (critical / constructive)

Document your exact dataset source and preprocessing choices in the notebooks. Report class balance and cross-validation strategy explicitly — otherwise reported metrics are unreliable. Add a short limitations paragraph in the project description (we included it here) and consider explainability (SHAP) before claiming actionable insights.

If you want, I can:

generate a requirements.txt for this repo,

create the train_and_eval.py script skeleton, or

write a short LICENSE file. Which one first?
